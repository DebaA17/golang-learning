# Go Language Learning Path

Hi! I'm a BCA 3rd semester student passionate about DevOps, Cloud, and Cybersecurity. This repository documents my journey learning Go (Golang), with practical code samples, exercises, and notes. My goal is to build a strong foundation in Go while exploring how it connects to modern infrastructure and security practices.


## Folder Structure

- `hello-world/`  
   Basic "Hello, World!" example in Go.


## Getting Started

To run any Go code in this repository:

1. Make sure you have Go installed. You can download it from [golang.org](https://golang.org/dl/).
2. Navigate to the folder containing the code you want to run.
3. Use the following command to run a Go file:
   ```sh
   go run <filename.go>
   ```


## Learning Topics

This repository will cover:
- Go basics (syntax, variables, types)
- Functions and methods
- Control structures (if, for, switch)
- Packages and modules
- Error handling
- Concurrency (goroutines, channels)
- Structs and interfaces
- File I/O
- Testing in Go

### Special Interests
- DevOps: Automating workflows, CI/CD, and infrastructure as code with Go
- Cloud: Exploring Go for cloud-native development and microservices
- Cybersecurity: Writing secure Go code and understanding security best practices
